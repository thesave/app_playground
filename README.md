## reachability
Premutation-based algorithm to check reachability of a function dependency graph with affinity constraints.

Download the compiled version from the [Releases](https://github.com/thesave/app_playground/releases) menu.

Command:
`java -jar reachability.jar path/to/nodelist.txt 10 [--debug]`

The nodelist format assumes that the first line corresponds to the root of the DAG.

You can look at an example in the project's folder: [nodeList_example.txt](https://github.com/thesave/app_playground/blob/main/reachability/nodeList_example.txt)

Nodelist format:
```
nodeName weight dep1 dep2 dep3
dep1 weight dep3 dep4 
...```
